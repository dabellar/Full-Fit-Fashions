# CS 132 Final Project
## Web Development with El Hovik

In the spring term of 2023-2024, I took CS 132, Caltech's web dev course. For our final project, we needed to use all the techniques we learned to create our own e-commerce store. 

One of the main questions we needed to answer with our final project was "What exactly does your e-commerce store hope to accomplish? (Many e-commerce stores already exist, why is yours different)". In my project proposal, I wrote, "I plan on making a "build and buy" clothing store, where instead of buying clothing pieces one by one, the main page will allow users to make an outfit and add it to their cart. Sometimes I'll find something I like and then have a hard time visualizing a full outfit in my head.". 

In a previous assignment, I recreated Cher's outfit picker in *Clueless*. This is, in a way, a continuation of that project. 

The *planningPhase* folder holds all the wireframes and flowcharts I made for this website.
